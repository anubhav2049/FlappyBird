# FlappyBird
A replica of the famous game FlappyBird, made in Unity (for the Windows). The actual, fully finished executable is located in the folder: "BuildV1.1 --> Windows --> x64". Else, you are free to explore the scripts, assets, unfinished builds etc :) 
The project by no means is as optimized as the original FlappyBird, and I have no connection to the original developers. This is by no means meant to be a profit project of any kind, it is just a replica I made for fun and for practicing my Unity skills. No copyright infringement is intended. 
Have fun :)
